 *         This class represents the CODEC for the resulting composite data from
 *         the batch install operations on the bundles in the
 *         <link>FrameworkMBean</link>. It serves as both the documentation of
 *         the type structure and as the codification of the mechanism to
 *         convert to/from the CompositeData.
 *         <p>
 *         The structure of the composite data is:
 *         <table border="1">
 *         <tr>
 *         <td>Success</td>
 *         <td>Boolean</td>
 *         </tr>
 *         <tr>
 *         <td>Error</td>
 *         <td>String</td>
 *         </tr>
 *         <tr>
 *         <td>Completed</td>
